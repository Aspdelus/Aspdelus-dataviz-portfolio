# Aspdelus-dataviz-portfolio
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://aspdelus.github.io/Aspdelus-dataviz-portfolio/
- This repository: https://github.com/Aspdelus/Aspdelus-dataviz-portfolio/

# Portfolio

# About me
Hi! My name is Aspdelus and I am currently pursuing MISM at Carnegie Mellon University. I am passionate about transforming complex data into compelling visual narratives that can inform decision-making and drive insights. With a background in Data Science, I bring a unique perspective to data storytelling that combines analytical rigor with creative visualization techniques.

In my spare time, I enjoy JPop Music, which helps me maintain a balanced approach to both work and life. I believe that effective data visualization is not just about presenting numbers, but about telling meaningful stories that resonate with audiences and inspire action.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to develop a strong foundation in data visualization principles and techniques that will allow me to create impactful visual stories. I am particularly interested in learning how to effectively communicate complex data to diverse audiences through compelling visual narratives.

My goals for this course include:
- Mastering various visualization tools and technologies
- Understanding the cognitive principles behind effective data communication
- Developing a critical eye for evaluating visualizations
- Building a portfolio of work that demonstrates my skills and creativity

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
